This repository contains information about my professional life.

## A brief history

Here are some important milestones and experiences in my life that have informed who I am and what I think today.

* I graduated Vanderbilt in 4 years with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics (minor in Economics), and a Master of Science in Computer Science.
* I learned web development at AdMob for 2 years. While I was there we grew from ~60 to ~170 employees. Google acquired AdMob.
* I got married.
* I continued learning web development at Google for 2 years and became a tech lead.
* I learned how to make native mobile apps (Android, iOS) at Maybe (a 5 person startup) for 8 months. LinkedIn acquihired us to build mobile apps.
* I built multiple apps at LinkedIn, became a tech lead, and built shared mobile infrastructure for almost 4 years.
* I became a father.
* I am currently learning how to become a better engineer and manage a team of engineers at Sourcegraph.

## What motivates me?

I try to optimize for learning new things and working with smart people (who I can learn from).

I enjoy working on products that both create a lot of value, and are morally "good".

## What do I believe?

I have written down some of my thoughts and learnings about being a [manager](manager.md) and an [engineer](engineer.md).
