# Manager

This document is an introduction to my thoughts on being a manager (inspired by https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe).

This document is:

* **Aspirational.** I am still learning, and I still make mistakes.
* **My voice.** I have received inspiration for many of these ideas from many sources, but nothing is copy/pasted. I thought about every word before adding it to this document.
* **Living.** My opinions have changed and will continue to change over time based on my experiences.

## Who am I?

Read [my background](background.md). My past experiences motivate and inform everything I do and think today.

## What you should expect from me

My goal as your manager is to help you achieve your goals.

To do this successfully, I need to:

* Know what your goals are.
* Understand what motivates you.
* Identify projects that align your goals with the team's goals.
* Challenge you to improve.
* Give you honest, direct, and constructive feedback about how I think you are progressing toward your goals.

All this is accomplished through the revolutionary technology of talking to each other regularly.

## My assumptions

**You are good at your job.** We would not have hired you if we thought otherwise.

**We can learn from each other.** You have a different set of experiences than I do. Taking about those experiences is an efficient way for each of us to learn lessons without having to repeat the other's mistakes.

**We are not going to agree all the time.** This is ok. If there is some data we could collect to make a better decision, then let's collect the data. If there isn't, then the owner of the decision gets to decide (sometimes that is you and sometimes that is me).

## What I expect from you

I expect you to:

* **Solve problems efficiently.** You job is not to check email, reply to Slack messages, close issues, review code, write code, etc. You job is to solve problems. You may need to do those things incidentally, but they are the means, not the end. Your goal is always to solve actual problems with as minimimal work as possible.
* **Be a scientist.** Programming is an artifact of understanding. Understanding comes from learning. Learning comes from experimentation.
* **Be introspective.** Admit to yourself (and to anyone involved) when you have made a mistake. Apologize if necessary. Challenge yourself to not repeat that mistake.
* **Listen.** You learn by listening, not by talking. Optimize for learning. Bonus: if you talk infrequently, others will listen more when you do.
* **Help your teammates.** We are all trying to learn and grow. An effective team can accomplish more than the individuals on it can accomplish alone.
* **Be compassionate.** _It is better to be loving than to be right - [Jeff Weiner](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/business/jeff-weiner-of-linkedin-on-the-next-play-philosophy.html?pagewanted=all)_.

Come speak to me immediately if:

* I am failing you in some way.
* You have have feedback to give me.
* You are blocked, unhappy, or frustrated.
* You are missing context
  * Personal/team/company goals are unclear.
  * You don't have enough information to make a decision.

## 1 on 1 meetings

These meetings are for us to discuss anything that you want. If you have something particular to discuss, let's start there. Sometimes I have things I want to discuss.

In the abscence of an obvious topic, here are some things we might talk about:

* What is on your mind?
* What has been going well?
* What hasn't been going well?
* What are you most worried about?

I generally do NOT want a status update (i.e. what you are working on and what you will be working on next), unless there is a particular reason why you want to discuss status. Your status will generally change much more frequently (e.g. every day) than we have our regular 1:1 (e.g. weekly) so effective status updates need to happen outside of the scope of our 1:1s (e.g. via Slack or ad hoc conversations).

I will setup a default 1:1 cadence and we can always adjust it from there according to your preferences.

Our relationship depends on regular communication, so if you need to miss a scheduled 1:1, please find a new time on our calendars and reschedule it. I will do the same.

## Feedback

Having an open channel of feedback is critical for learning and development. This goes both ways (me giving you feedback and you giving me feedback).

Feedback can be positive, or corrective. Both should be delivered directly and as soon as possible. In person is best.

Corrective feedback is a learning opportunity. Sometimes it is just a problem statement without an obvious solution. We can talk through it.

## Work hours

My schedule is pretty rigid because:

* I commute to San Francisco via train (about 1hr total commute each way).
* I want to see my daughter when she is awake.

I am generally in the office 8:30am-5pm on weekdays. I try to be productive on the train, but I have limited data connectivity.

Once I get home, I reserve the right to be unresponsive to messages (even if I just sent one) and I have my Slack notification preferences set accordingly. I expect the same from you.

Sometimes I choose to open my laptop after my daughter goes to bed, or on the weekends because I find my work engaging. This time is unpredictable so I do not rely on it.

Your exact schedule is up to you, but you should be in the office every weekday with some sensible overlap with normal business hours.

## Time shifting

It is ok to time shift your work occasionally. Communicate your plans with me first and then with the team. When communicating, be explicit about when you will be gone, and when you are making up that work. Add it to the shared calendar.

## Sick time

If you are sick, stay home and get rest. You do not need a note from a doctor; just post a message in Slack to let the team know.

## Vacation

The point of vacation is to disconnect from your job and give your brain a break. If you are checking email or Slack, you are doing it wrong (it is hard to stop, I know).

Let me know when you plan to take vacation and add it to the shared calendar.

If you feel like things will fall apart when you are gone, you probably haven't done your job well.

* Your code should be documented and tested so someone else can fix/improve it without breaking anything while you are gone.
* You should not be a gatekeeper for code reviews. If you are, you should spend more time teaching teammates, writing guides, and automating quality checkers.

## Notes

Test coverage 100%

Choose one: scope, quality, speed.

Argue against a characature
Be a scientist

Debating safe debate

You are not being paid to close issues, check email, review code.
